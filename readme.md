# New Site

This is the project I use to build every new site. I'll be slowly improving it over time, adding new features, attempting to implement new coding standards, etc.

For information on how to clone this repo, how to use my Gulp tasks, and more, take a look at my [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- Clearly organized SCSS closely in line with the [SMACSS methodology](https://smacss.com/)
- Minified & Concated JS, CSS, and HTML with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- Integration with FontAwesome
- Drop downs that work on tablets & desktops
- Incredible one elment hamburger-style menu icon with great animations and no images
- Awesome slide-out mobile menu, with beautiful animations
- Integration with [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/)

## Planned

- Semi-auto generated WordPress theme using if gulp-file-include if statements
- Complete FontAwesome icon map (time consuming and I'm lazy)
- Better FontAwesome mixin
- Dynamic grid system
- SCSS Extends support (need to research this a bit more)
- rem/em mixins that adhere to DRY standards (eh?)
- Awesome [MSN-style](http://www.msn.com/) tablet menu (tap arrows to pan between long nav on tablet view)

## Considering

- Markdown for src files
- Framework for rapid deployment
- [Switch back to px instead of rem/em](http://benfrain.com/just-use-pixels/)
- [Change colors to a SASS map](https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors)
- [DashIcons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) integration (currently partially supported, would just need to import the actual font & finish the map)
