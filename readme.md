# new-site

I'm rethinking how my build process should work. I want things it to be more like a web app, with versioning, distributions, etc. This is the start of that project.

## Goals

- Synced /src/assets/ with [new-site-static](https://github.com/revxx14/new-site-static) (new-site-assets?)
- Versioning
- Documentation
- Proper SMACSS
- Ability to set up /dist/ as a submodule, which could then be used to deploy
- style.css should pull data from package.json
