New Site
========

This is the project I use to build every new site. I'll be slowly improving it over time, adding new features, attempting to implement new coding standards, etc.

Features
--------

* Great mixins for rem/em

* Clearly organized SCSS

* Integration with FontAwesome

* Drop downs that work on tablets & desktops

* Incredible one elment hamburger-style menu icon with great animations and no images

* Awesome slide-out mobile menu, with beautiful animations

Planned
-------

* Dynamic grid system

* Framework for rapid deployment

* SCSS Extends support (need to research this a bit more)

* Pull left/right to open menu using [Hammer JS](http://hammerjs.github.io/)

* Integration with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - [specifically this](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-gulp-for-wordpress-automation--cms-23081)

* Improved rem/em mixins to adhere to DRY standards


Considering
-----------

* [Switch back to px instead of rem/em](http://benfrain.com/just-use-pixels/)

* [Change colors to a SASS map](https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors)
