New Site
========

This is the project I use to build every new site. I'll be slowly improving it over time, adding new features, attempting to implement new coding standards, etc.

Features
--------

* Clearly organized SCSS

* Minified & Concated JS using [Prepros](http://www.prepros.io/)

* Integration with FontAwesome

* Drop downs that work on tablets & desktops

* Incredible one elment hamburger-style menu icon with great animations and no images

* Awesome slide-out mobile menu, with beautiful animations

* Integration with [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/)

Planned
-------

* Complete FontAwesome icon map (time consuming and I'm lazy)

* Better FontAwesome mixin

* Dynamic grid system

* SCSS Extends support (need to research this a bit more)

* Pull left/right to open menu using [Hammer JS](http://hammerjs.github.io/) (or another touch library)

* rem/em mixins that adhere to DRY standards (eh?)

Considering
-----------

* Framework for rapid deployment

* [Switch back to px instead of rem/em](http://benfrain.com/just-use-pixels/)

* [Change colors to a SASS map](https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors)

* [DashIcons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) integration (currently partially supported, would just need to import the actual font & finish the map)
